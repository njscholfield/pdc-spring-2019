      <p>In 2012, Pittsburgh completed an <a href="https://www.treepittsburgh.org/resource/pittsburgh-urban-forest-master-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Urban Forest Master Plan (UFMP)</a> which was a project dedicated to determing the amount of tree cover in Pittsburgh, and providing recommendations for how to increase tree cover in neighborhoods where it is lacking. This plan determined that Pittsburgh had an average tree canopy cover of 42%, however, some neighborhoods had much greater tree cover than others. Take a look at the heatmap that I created below to see where all the trees in Pittsburgh are. As you can see, some areas are very well covered by trees, while other areas are not.</p>
